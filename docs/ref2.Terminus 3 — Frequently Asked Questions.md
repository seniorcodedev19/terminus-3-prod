1. Getting Started & Onboarding
How do I get started on this project? Review the project website, then check pinned posts in #terminus-3-submissions and #terminus-3-announcements. Once you've reviewed the materials, complete the Terminus-3-Prod-Assessment on your Snorkel dashboard under "My Projects." You must score 80% or higher to advance and will receive your results with next steps via Slack DM once ready.

Where do I find the assessment? On your dashboard, look for Terminus-3-Prod-Assessment under "My Projects" (you may need to scroll or search). Click the Submissions node to begin. If you don't see it, ask in #terminus-3-submissions.

How soon do I need to take the assessment? Are there deadlines? No deadlines — take it whenever you're ready. However, the assessment has a 90-minute time limit once started, so review the materials first.

I passed the assessment — what happens next? A team member will contact you with results, typically the next business day (excluding weekends).

Are there training videos? Yes — three videos by fellow Terminus Expert Brady Nguyen: Understanding Terminus, Understanding Submissions, and Understanding Revisions. Available on the onboarding page.

Where is the task gallery? I logged in but don't see any tasks. The task gallery and the submission portal are separate sites. The gallery (browse/choose tasks) is on the documentation site. The portal (upload completed work) is on the Snorkel Experts platform. Build locally from the gallery, then submit through the portal.

Should I wait for my first task to be reviewed before starting another? No — work on and submit multiple tasks in parallel.

How do I initialize a new task with the CLI? stb init my-task-name -p "Terminus-3-Prod"

This downloads the Terminus 3 task skeleton into my-task-name/. Terminus 3 has a single template, so the template flag (-t) is optional — stb init my-task-name -p "Terminus-3-Prod" -t default does the same thing.

You can also download the task skeleton directly and rename the folder.

2. CLI Setup & API Keys
I'm getting "Your account is not assigned to any Terminal-Bench project." Expected if you haven't been onboarded to the main project yet. Complete and pass the assessment first, then wait for team confirmation. CLI and API keys only work after assignment.

I hit the maximum key refresh limit (20). Post in #terminus-3-submissions and ask an admin to reset your key. They can delete the old key so you can regenerate, or top it up manually. You don't need to run the refresh command after an admin resets it.

stb login works but stb keys refresh fails with "Authentication failed." Known intermittent issue. Try: (1) regenerate a new API key in the browser using the "Copy" button, (2) run stb login again, then (3) retry stb keys refresh. If it persists, post in Slack and tag the team.

How do I get an API key for agent testing? You don't need your own. The project provides AI credentials through the CLI — follow the CLI User Guide and run stb keys refresh.

My API key is exhausted or giving errors mid-work. Keys have a usage budget. Run stb keys refresh for a new one. There's a cap on how many times you can refresh; once you hit it, ask an admin to reset or raise it. Keys can also become temporarily rate-limited — wait a few minutes and retry. Running concurrent agent tests exhausts keys faster.

I'm having trouble upgrading stb. Follow the upgrade command in the CLI User Guide. A 403 Forbidden error usually means the download link was temporarily rotated — try again later. Always verify your version with stb --version before troubleshooting other issues.

Installing harbor gives a 403 Forbidden. That install method is retired — the old Harbor wheel URL no longer serves. Install the Snorkel CLI (snorkelai-stb) instead, per the Quick Start. You no longer need to set OPENAI_API_KEY / OPENAI_BASE_URL manually — stb login and stb keys refresh handle AI credentials for agent runs.

3. Task Structure & File Layout
What files does a task require?

task.toml	Metadata and manifest, including the difficulty_explanation / solution_explanation / verification_explanation / relevant_experience write-ups — see Task Components
instruction.md	The goal, kept concise — around 2 short paragraphs or 20 bullets
environment/Dockerfile	Agent-facing environment (or docker-compose.yaml for multi-container)
environment/data/	Bundled inputs
solution/solve.sh	Oracle solution; helper scripts allowed alongside it
tests/Dockerfile	Verifier image — built and run separately from the agent environment
tests/test.sh	Verifier entrypoint
tests/test_outputs.py	Python pytest tests
README.md	Task documentation — added by Snorkel at packaging, not authored by you
rubrics.txt and README.md also ship in the task directory, but Snorkel adds both at packaging — rubrics.txt from the rubric you generate in the platform UI, and README.md from the explanation fields in your task.toml. You don't author either.

Are milestone tasks still supported? No. Milestone / multi-step tasks are not part of Terminus 3. Every task is a single-shot, outcome-verified problem.

Where do tests run? In a separate container, built from tests/Dockerfile. The agent cannot see or reach it. Terminus requires the explicit [verifier].environment_mode = "separate" key (Harbor would also treat a [verifier.environment] table as separate, and defaults to shared if neither is set — Terminus CI rejects both).

How does the verifier see the agent's work? Only through the paths you declare in the top-level artifacts array. Nothing else crosses over — and the parent directories for those paths must already exist in the verifier image. Nesting artifacts under [verifier] silently drops it.

Do I need to write a README? No. Snorkel adds README.md at packaging, assembled from the difficulty_explanation, solution_explanation, verification_explanation, and relevant_experience fields in your task.toml, along with the task's category and subcategory. Write those fields well and the README takes care of itself. Agents never see it either way.

4. Difficulty & Language
Difficulty
How is difficulty determined? Empirically. Accuracy = mean pass@1 across 8 runs — 4 per model, over both GPT-5.6 and Claude Opus 5. Tiers: Frontier < 20%, Advanced 20–50%, Core 50–80%, Base 80–100%. Tasks above 80% are not rejected — Base is a wanted tier, but 100% averaged across both models is not accepted: a task every run solves gives no signal. There is no language-specific difficulty rule. See Difficulty Guidelines.

Why does the in-platform check run fewer trials than the final measurement? Difficulty is measured in two stages. While you iterate, the platform runs 2 trials per model across both models — 4 runs total. The full 8-run measurement (4 per model) happens only after a reviewer accepts your task, and that is what sets your final tier.

The tier shown while iterating is provisional. It comes from 4 runs, not 8, so a task can shift tiers between the two. Don't treat the iteration result as final.

My task passed every run in the platform check. Why can't I submit it? At least one of the 4 iteration runs must fail. A task that every run solves produces no signal about agent capability, so it can't proceed to review. Make the task genuinely harder — don't just tighten a numeric threshold, which shows up as a near_miss flag rather than real difficulty.

My task keeps coming back too easy. What makes a task land in the harder tiers? Requirements the agent must infer rather than read off a checklist, outputs judged on semantics rather than appearance, and several correctness axes that interact. Single-bug or template-based tasks tend to land in Core or Base. See Difficulty Guidelines.

My non-Python task (e.g., Go) is being classified as a Python task. All verifier tests are written in Python pytest, but Python test infrastructure alone should not be listed in task.toml languages. The languages field should describe the main task/oracle/agent work. Remove Python from languages if it is present only because of tests/test_outputs.py.

Timeouts & Concurrency
What is the agent timeout? [agent].timeout_sec has a minimum of 1800 seconds (30 minutes) and a ceiling of 18000 seconds (5 hours). Most Terminus 3 tasks sit in the 60–90 minute range.

Changed from Terminus 2nd Edition, where 1800 seconds was the maximum.

Can I run concurrent agent tests (GPT-5.6 and Opus at the same time)? It's possible, but not encouraged — expect API errors and much faster key exhaustion. Run one model's tests to completion before starting the other. See Using Your API Key Efficiently in the CLI User Guide for tips on stretching your key budget.

Category Status
Can I submit new tasks? Yes. As of Jul 30, 2026, submissions are open across every category for the final push — the Jul 27 pause has been lifted.

Which categories are currently blocked? None. All seven Terminus 3 categories — Science, Software, ML, Operations, Security, Hardware, Media — are open. Milestone tasks are not part of Terminus 3 at all. Check the Task Category Status page for the live list.

Should I still work my revision queue? Yes. Revisions continue as normal, and clearing your Revision Queue is still the most direct path to getting existing submissions to Accepted.

5. Testing & Docker Troubleshooting
Solvable vs. passing a run
What’s the difference between a task being “solvable” and the agent “passing a run”?

Passing a run means a single agent run where all unit tests pass.
Solvable (for the benchmark / CI) means that across all agent runs, each individual unit test passes at least once (not necessarily in the same run). A task can have no run where every test passes and still be solvable—the model may only satisfy different parts of the task on different runs. Unsolvable means at least one test never passes in any of those runs.
To replicate this locally with -k 10:

bash

Copy
stb harbor run -m @openai/gpt-5.6 -p ./task -k 10
stb harbor run -m @anthropic/claude-opus-5 -p ./task -k 10
What are the correct model strings?

GPT	@openai/gpt-5.6	gpt-5.6 (missing @openai/), gpt-5-6, @openai-tbench/gpt-5-6
Claude Opus	@anthropic/claude-opus-5	—
Keep the @provider/ prefix and use the string exactly as written. If you see INVALID_MODEL_NOT_ALLOWED, double-check it against this table.

502 Bad Gateway or RateLimitError with Opus 5, but GPT-5.6 works fine. Regenerate a fresh API key. If it persists, run with --debug and share the output in Slack.

Common Build & Test Failures
Do tests have to be written in Python? Yes. All verifier assertions must be Python pytest tests (tests/test_outputs.py). tests/test.sh is a bash wrapper that runs pytest and writes the reward file; it should not invoke Java, JavaScript, Go, or other language-specific test frameworks directly. For non-Python tasks, use Python pytest tests to call the relevant command, service, or output files.

My task passes locally but fails on the platform — reward.txt not found. Almost always one of three causes:

Cause 1: Entrypoint blocks execution. If entrypoint.sh ends with a blocking command like exec nginx -g 'daemon off;', it prevents test.sh from running. Fix:

bash

Copy
nginx
exec "$@"
Cause 2: set -euo pipefail causes early exit. If any command fails before writing reward.txt, the script exits. Drop -e and capture the exit code. Pytest and any plugins should be pre-installed in the Docker image; test.sh should only run the verifier and write the reward file (see Writing Tests):

bash

Copy
set -uo pipefail
mkdir -p /logs/verifier

python -m pytest --ctrf /logs/verifier/ctrf.json /tests/test_outputs.py -rA && rc=0 || rc=$?

if [ $rc -eq 0 ]; then
  echo 1 > /logs/verifier/reward.txt
else
  echo 0 > /logs/verifier/reward.txt
fi
Cause 3: Missing output directory. Add mkdir -p /logs/verifier near the top of test.sh. The starter template may not include this line — add it yourself.

The quality check flags source "$HOME/.local/bin/env" as a typo. Known false positive — ignore it.

All my agent runs fail with no verifier output — verifier_did_not_run across every run, even on a simple task. The most common cause is missing tmux and/or asciinema in your Dockerfile. The agent runtime requires both to start a session — without them, agents cannot run at all regardless of task quality. Add them to your environment/Dockerfile:

dockerfile

Copy
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends tmux asciinema \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
The LLMaJ review says "NOT_APPLICABLE" with an empty summary. Agents couldn't start (often a tmux session failure — see above). Report the task UUID in Slack.

stb harbor check fails with "Claude Code returned an unexpected response" or a Usage Policy error. This is a provider content refusal, not a CLI bug and not a verdict on your task's correctness. The model running the quality check (Claude Code / Claude Sonnet 4.6) flagged something in your task content as potentially violating the Usage Policy. The surface error is misleading — you may see Received result: "success", but the operation was treated as a failure, while the underlying cause is API Error: Claude Code is unable to respond to this request, which appears to violate our Usage Policy. Try rephrasing the request in a new session or change your model. Work through these in order:

Re-run the check — refusals can be intermittent; a fresh session sometimes passes.
Switch the judge model — re-run with -m opus or -m claude-haiku-4-5. A refusal on one model frequently clears on another.
Review your task content — security/exploit/malware-adjacent framing, harmful instructions, or sensitive-looking data can trip the flag even for legitimate tasks. Where possible, frame the task in clearly legitimate, defensive/educational terms.
Escalate — if the task is legitimately security-related (e.g., a CTF or defensive-security task) and keeps refusing on every model, post the task UUID in #terminus-3-submissions so the team can review.
This is separate from the refusals trial-analysis flag, which reports that the agent under test aborted on a content policy during a difficulty trial. Same word, unrelated causes — see Difficulty Guidelines.

Docker Issues
My environment/app folder isn't being mounted in Harbor. Harbor sets the build context to environment/. If your Dockerfile references files outside that directory, Docker won't find them. Move everything your Dockerfile needs into environment/.

Docker network errors after running many tests. Run docker network prune to clean up stale networks.

My Dockerfile references a base image that seems unavailable. Some images may not be accessible on the platform. Post the exact image name and task UUID in Slack.

Preflight failed on COPY --chown= or COPY --from=. The cloud image builder rejects two patterns that work on local Docker. COPY --chown= must use numeric IDs (0:0, 1000:1000), not names such as root or appuser. COPY --from= image refs must drop the tag and keep the digest (golang@sha256:<digest>), not golang:1.24-bookworm@sha256:<digest>. Stage names (COPY --from=builder) and FROM image:tag@sha256:<digest> are unchanged. The preflight names the exact line. See Dockerfile Requirements → Cloud Image Builder Syntax.

Preflight failed on verifier_interpreter_permissions, or Oracle log collection failed with Bash Permission denied. On images where /bin is /usr/bin, /bin/bash and /usr/bin/bash are the same file. Saving a mode and disabling each path in turn can record 000 for the second path; restoring both leaves Bash non-executable. Harbor then fails to collect verifier logs (DownloadVerifierDirError) even if pytest wrote a reward. Resolve every path with Path.resolve(), deduplicate, restore each original mode once — do not hardcode 0755. The platform check scans every tests/**/*.py before Oracle and is not in stb harbor check. An unreadable or unparseable file is a warning that the scan is incomplete for that file, not a pass. See Writing Tests → Preserve Interpreter Permissions.

Which base image should I use? Prefer one of the 10 canonical digest-pinned images (Python, Node, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, GCC, Maven, Debian, Ubuntu) listed in Dockerfile Best Practices §2. Non-canonical images are allowed with a brief, credible justification as a Dockerfile comment; missing/vague justifications are blocked. Tasks whose CI passed before Jun 15, 2026 are grandfathered — reviewers shouldn't flag their base image (pinning is still required).

Can my tests contain solution logic or hardcoded values? Rigorous verifier logic is fine — running your own binary, parsing its output, golden fixtures/hashes, and spec-derived invariants are all legitimate. Two things to avoid: a callable function in tests/ that maps task inputs to the complete expected artifact (end-to-end solving belongs in solution/), and hardcoding values the instruction says the agent must read from a config file. Hardcoded expected results (exact numeric/ML targets) are fine and often required. See Writing Tests → What a Good Verifier Legitimately Does.

6. Submissions & Reviews
Submitting
How do I check the status of my tasks? How do I see what state my submissions are in? Use the CLI: stb submissions list -p PROJECT_ID returns every submission you've made for a project along with its current state. Add --show-folder-names to also see the local task folder name each submission came from (slower).

You can also drill into a specific submission:

stb submissions view SUBMISSION_ID — open the submission in the browser
stb submissions feedback SUBMISSION_ID — download the latest reviewer/automated feedback
stb submissions download SUBMISSION_ID — download the submitted task files
Submission status reference:

EVALUATION_PENDING	Automated checks running	No
NEEDS_REVISION	Reviewer requested changes — update with stb submissions update	Yes
REVIEW_PENDING	Waiting for a human reviewer	No
ACCEPTED	Task accepted	No
OFFERED	Offer made	No
REJECTED	Task rejected	No
SKIPPED	Task skipped	No
See the CLI User Guide → Check submission status for the full set of submission commands.

What is the quality panel judge? An automated four-axis review that runs (or is being wired in to run) before a human reviewer: contract disclosure, reference-solution correctness, whether ground truth is reachable, and whether the verifier can be passed without solving the task. Minor, Major, and Unsure block; only None on every axis auto-accepts. Walk the checklists in the Quality Panel Judge Guide before you submit. If you think a finding is wrong, contest it with the cited passage the same way you would a human note — see Defending Your Submission.

What are the submission limits?

You are a new contributor until your first task is accepted. After that you become a regular contributor and the higher limits apply.

Net-new submissions per day	2	5
Submissions in "needs revision"	1	1
Pending submissions	2	10
Only net-new submissions count toward the daily limit — revisions do not. Daily limits reset at midnight UTC (~7–8 PM EST).

What counts as a pending submission? Anything not yet accepted or rejected: needs revision, pending review, and pending adjudication all count. Reaching the cap blocks new assignments until something clears.

What happens when I have a submission in "needs revision"? It blocks new assignments — for new and regular contributors alike, the limit is one. Clear it before starting something new: either revise and resubmit, or hit "Discard", which rejects the task and removes it.

If you're blocked from a net-new submission while still under your daily limit, check both of the other two limits before reporting a bug — a submission in needs revision, or a full pending queue, will block you independently of the daily count.

My submission is auto-rejected by AutoEval even though it passes manual checks. Known intermittent issue. Resubmit. If persistent, post your submission ID and failing build ID in Slack.

All my quality checks pass and say "READY TO USE," but a reviewer still sent it back. "READY TO USE" is the automated agent review — it's not a guarantee of human approval. Reviewers evaluate rubric quality, instruction clarity, test coverage, and task design beyond what automated tools can assess.

Do I have to build the task exactly as the gallery idea describes? No — task ideas are starting points, not strict specs. Adapt, extend, or deviate as needed; your task just has to meet the quality and difficulty requirements.

Can I still download the task skeleton after claiming? Yes. The skeleton download appears on the claim-success screen and stays available anytime from My Tasks — open the claimed task and use Download Skeleton. (Previously it was only available pre-claim.)

Reviews & Disputes
How long does review take? Assessments: ~24 hours (excluding weekends). Task reviews: 1–7 business days.

My task keeps coming back with blank, incorrect, or mismatched feedback. Known caching issue — reviewers may receive stale or wrong zip files. If the feedback references files, code, or features not in your submission, dispute with screenshots and escalate in #terminus-3-submissions.

I disagree with the reviewer. What should I do? Use the dispute mechanism on the portal. Reference specific docs or announcements. If the reviewer keeps returning the same incorrect feedback, escalate in Slack by tagging the team.

Are new guidelines being applied to my old revisions? They shouldn't be — new rules are for new submissions only. If a reviewer enforces new requirements on an older task, flag it. Noelle has confirmed reviewers are aware of this distinction.

7. Rubrics & Quality Checks
What are the rubric requirements?

≥1 negative criterion per rubric	Hard requirement — triggers revision if missing
10–40 points (max cumulative score)	Flaggable, but not a sole reason for revision
Do positive rubric scores need an explicit + sign? Yes. Every positive score must be written +1/+2/+3/+5 — a bare 3 will be sent back for revision (High severity). Negative scores use -. See Rubrics → Strict Formatting Rules.

How do I generate rubrics? Check "Generate Rubric(s)" and submit without checking "Send to Reviewer". Generation happens during CI checks (not Fast Static Checks) — rubrics don't appear instantly. Editing is only possible through the portal UI.

My rubrics disappear or appear empty after a revision cycle. Known platform bug. Report with the task UUID in Slack.

How is the quality panel different from LLMaJ or Agent Review? LLMaJ and Agent Review are separate helpers (Agent Review does not block). The quality panel is a four-axis review being wired in as a blocking check before a human reviewer. See the Quality Panel Judge Guide.

8. Compensation & Payment
What's the pay per task? See the Rate Schedule for current rates and bonuses.

When do I get paid? Payouts follow a Friday-to-Thursday cycle — tasks accepted in that window are paid the following Friday. Example: accepted Monday the 7th → paid around Friday the 17th.

Do I get paid for tasks still in review? No. Payout happens only if your submission reaches the state of 'Accepted'

Can I get paid for tasks from Terminus 1st Edition? No. That project was deprecated December 2025. Non-accepted tasks from it will not be paid.

9. Project Scope & Support
How long will this project last? Terminus 3 is running now. Timelines are announced in Slack.

Are there deadlines? No — work at your own pace.

Will more tasks be added to the gallery? Periodically, yes. If it looks sparse, check back or ask in Slack.

Are there office hours? Yes. The current schedule is pinned at the top of the #terminus-3-announcements Slack channel under the "Office Hours" section — that's where you'll find the latest dates, times, and Zoom links. Sessions are held multiple times per week (typically each weekday). See the Office Hours page for more details.

Where should I ask questions?

#terminus-3-submissions	General questions, tech issues, submission help
#terminus-3-announcements	Guideline updates (read-only for most)
