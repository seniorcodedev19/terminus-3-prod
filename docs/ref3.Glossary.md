Key terms and definitions used throughout Terminus 3.

A
Agent
An AI system that can write, execute, and iterate on code autonomously. Unlike simple code completion, agents can plan multi-step solutions, execute commands, read results, and recover from errors.

Agentic AI
AI systems designed to take actions and make decisions autonomously rather than simply responding to prompts. Agentic coding AI can execute code, read results, and iterate toward a goal.

B
Benchmark
A standardized set of tasks used to measure and compare the performance of AI systems. Terminal-Bench 3.0 is the benchmark Terminus 3 targets.

Branch
A separate line of development in Git. Each task should be developed on its own branch (e.g., username/task-name) before being merged.

C
CI (Continuous Integration)
Automated systems that run tests and checks when code is submitted. In Terminus 3, CI validates task structure, dependencies, and quality.

Claude Code
Anthropic's agentic coding system that uses Claude Sonnet 4.5. One of the models used to evaluate task difficulty.

Codex
OpenAI's code-focused agent. Used with GPT-5.6 to evaluate task difficulty.

D
Dockerfile
A script that defines how to build a Docker container. In Terminus 3, it sets up the task environment with all required dependencies, digest-pinned base images, and no copied solution or test files.

docker-compose.yaml
Configuration file that defines how containers, volumes, and networks are orchestrated for a task.

F
Frontier Model
The most capable AI models available at any given time. Currently includes GPT-5.6 and Claude Opus 5.

G
Ground Truth
The verified correct solution for a task. In Terminus 3, this is the oracle solution (solve.sh).

L
LLMaJ (LLM-as-Judge)
Using a language model (Claude Sonnet 4.6) to evaluate task quality. LLMaJ checks assess things like test coverage, clarity, and anti-cheating measures.

O
Oracle Agent
A special agent that runs your solution/solve.sh script to verify the task is solvable. If the Oracle can't complete your task, it's broken.

Oracle Solution
The expert-authored step-by-step solution contained in solution/solve.sh. Must reliably complete the task when executed.

P
Pass Rate
The percentage of times an agent successfully completes a task. Calculated from multiple runs (4) against each model.

Privileged Mode
A Docker setting that gives containers root-level access. Not allowed in Terminus 3 tasks.

R
tests/test.sh
Script that executes the Python pytest tests to verify task completion. Must set up the pytest command using uv and produce a reward file (/logs/verifier/reward.txt or /logs/verifier/reward.json). It should not delegate verification to another language-specific test framework.

Ruff
A fast Python linter. All Python code in tasks must pass Ruff checks.

S
Snorkel Expert Platform
The web-based platform for managing tasks and submissions. Alternative to the GitHub workflow.

Solvable
A task is solvable when, across all agent runs, each individual unit test passes at least once (in some run, not necessarily the same run). A task can fail to pass a run on every attempt (no run has all tests green) and still be solvable: the agent may satisfy different parts of the task in different runs without ever putting everything together in one go. Unsolvable means at least one unit test never passes in any of those runs. CI automatically blocks tasks that are unsolvable by this check.

This meaning of solvable is separate from the Oracle Agent sense (that solution/solve.sh can complete the task). See Oracle Agent.

solve.sh / solution/solve.sh
The oracle solution script that demonstrates how to complete the task. Located in solution/solve.sh.

Harbor
The task validation and testing framework used for running agents and validating tasks. Contributors invoke it through the Snorkel CLI as stb harbor … — e.g., run stb harbor run -a oracle -p <task-folder> to test your task.

T
Task
A coding challenge designed to test AI agent capabilities. Consists of:

Instructions (instruction.md)
Configuration (task.toml)
Environment (environment/Dockerfile)
Solution (solution/solve.sh)
Tests (tests/test.sh, tests/test_outputs.py)
instruction.md
The task instruction file in markdown format, shown to agents. Contains clear, unambiguous requirements.

task.toml
The task configuration file in TOML format, containing metadata and settings. Replaces task.yaml in Harbor 2.0. Descriptive fields live under [metadata], resource and network settings under [environment], and artifacts stays top-level. See Task Components.

Terminal-Bench
The benchmark project Terminus 3 targets. See tbench.ai.

Terminus
The internal name for this Terminus 3 project at Snorkel.

test_outputs.py
The required Python pytest file containing tests that verify task completion. Must have informative docstrings on all tests.

Timeout
Maximum time (in seconds) allowed for an agent to complete a task. Specified in task.toml under [agent].timeout_sec.

Artifacts
The paths declared in a task's top-level artifacts array. These are the only files copied from the agent's final environment into the separate verifier container. Nesting artifacts under [verifier] silently drops it.

Separate verifier
The Terminus 3 grading model: the verifier runs in its own container, built from tests/Dockerfile, which the agent cannot see or reach. Terminus requires the explicit [verifier].environment_mode = "separate" key. Harbor also treats a [verifier.environment] table as separate and defaults to shared if neither is set; Terminus CI rejects both the implicit-only form and that shared default.

Quality panel
An automated four-axis review of a submitted task (coherent_contract, correct_reference_solution, protected_ground_truth, sound_verifier) being wired in as a blocking check before a human reviewer. Minor, Major, and Unsure block; only None on every axis auto-accepts. See Quality Panel Judge Guide.

Difficulty tiers
The four empirical tiers — Frontier (<20%), Advanced (20–50%), Core (50–80%), Base (80–100%) — assigned from measured accuracy rather than self-assessment.

Accuracy
Average pass@1 across 8 runs — 4 per model, over both GPT-5.6 and Claude Opus 5. Determines a task's difficulty tier. In-platform iteration uses a shorter 4-run check (2 per model).

Canary string
A marker used to keep benchmark data out of training corpora. Terminus 3 is a training dataset, so canary strings must not appear in any task component.

network_mode
The task.toml setting declaring network access, set per phase. [environment].network_mode must be "public" on every task — the image build and harness install need the network. [agent].network_mode and [verifier].network_mode are "public" or "no-network" as the task requires; an offline task keeps the environment public and closes the agent.

Terminal-Bench 3.0
The benchmark Terminus 3 tasks target.
